# Temperature and Humidity Detection Using DHT11 Sensor with Arduino Uno

## Overview
This project interfaces a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with an Arduino Uno to monitor environmental conditions. The code reads temperature and humidity data from the sensor and outputs it to the serial monitor. This is helpful for basic IoT or climate monitoring applications.

## Components
- **Arduino Uno**
- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **Jumper wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional)

## Setup

1. **Circuit Connections**  
   - Connect the **VCC** pin of the DHT11 to the **5V** pin on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the **GND** pin of the DHT11 to the **GND** pin on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the **DATA** pin of the DHT11 to **digital pin 2** on the Arduino Uno.

2. **Installing DHT Library**  
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for "DHT sensor library" and install the one by Adafruit.

3. **Uploading Code**  
   - Open the provided `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

## How to Run
1. After uploading, open the **Serial Monitor** (found under **Tools > Serial Monitor**) in the Arduino IDE.
2. Set the baud rate to **9600**.
3. Every 2 seconds, you will see the temperature (in Celsius) and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor displayed on the Serial Monitor.

## Expected Output
Example output on Serial Monitor:
```
Humidity: 45.0 %    Temperature: 25.0 *C
```

## Notes
- The DHT11 sensor has a humidity range of 20-90% and temperature range of 0-50Â°C.
- Data refreshes every 2 seconds in the current configuration.
- If data is not displayed, ensure connections are correct and the DHT library is installed.

## Troubleshooting
- **No output or error**: Verify sensor connections, ensure DHT11 sensor is properly connected to digital pin 2.
- **"Failed to read from DHT sensor!" message**: This indicates a communication issue. Recheck the wiring and ensure the sensor is not faulty.
